Dataset Description
For this study, we utilized the publicly available Barbell Exercise Tracking IMU Dataset [11] compiled by Ebbelaar [4]. This dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope recordings captured from a single wrist-worn IMU while five participants (A, B, C, D, E) performed exercises such as bench, squat, dead, ohp, and row. The accelerometer and gyroscope captures measurements in the x, y and z axis. The accelerometer measures tri-axis linear acceleration in meters per second squared. The gyroscope measures tri-axis angular velocity (rate of rotation) in degrees per second. The data collection occurs at 12.5 Hz for Accelerometer and 25 Hz for Gyroscope.
The dataset comprises several csv files where each file corresponds to a particular exercise, participant and either accelerometer or gyroscope measurements with a unique time stamp. Since the accelerometer and gyroscope captures measurements at different frequencies, aggregation of data is crucial to analyse the motion pattern. Aggregation at t=0.20s reduces loss of information.
